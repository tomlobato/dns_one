# DnsOne

Instead having a complex data schema to assign record sets to individual DNS zones, dns_one assigns one or few record to many zones. Configure your zones in YML files and fetch your domains from a database or YML backend.

## Installation

    # gem install dns_one

## Usage

    # dns_one install

Configure ```/etc/dns_one/conf.yml```. Then:

    # dns_one start

Also:

    # dns_one status
    # dns_one stop
    # dns_one uninstall

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
