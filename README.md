Instead having a complex data schema to assign record sets to DNS zones, dns_one assigns one or a few record sets to many zones.

Configure your record sets in YML files and fetch your domains from a database or YML backend.

*DnsOne is written on top of the great gem [https://github.com/socketry/rubydns](https://github.com/socketry/rubydns). Big thanks!
